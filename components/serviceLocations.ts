    "centre_description": "Our 8-week outpatient cardiac health program is generally recommended by the patient’s cardiologist or nurse as an important step in their recovery plan. Patients can also be referred by their GP or specialist as a preventive measure. Our goal at Brellah is to help those with heart conditions better manage their symptoms, as well as support those preparing for or having had heart procedures, to regain their health and return to work, activities and the tasks of daily living.",
